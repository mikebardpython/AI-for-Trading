# Alpha Research and Factor Modeling
* build a statistical risk model using PCA
* use this model to build a portfolio along with 5 alpha factors
* create these factors, then evaluate them using factor-weighted returns, quantile analysis, sharpe ratio, and turnover analysis
* optimize the portfolio using the risk model and factors using multiple optimization formulations

For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia and sector data from Sharadar.
