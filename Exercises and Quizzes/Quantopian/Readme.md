Many of the exercises in the AI for Trading nanodegree involve ingesting a bundle and performing some kind of analysis on this dataset. I learn best when i replicate the notebooks myself. The data used is a bit old and there are some issues where we are not able to source more recent data from the sources mentioned in the zipline documentation.

As an alternative method i tried to replicate the learning sessions myself using the quantopian website.

** to run this properly you must upload these to the quantopian website or retype them yourself in a quantopian research notebook ( which suggest avoiding unless you have lots of time or like woudl like to practice your typing skills, perhaps on your new kenesis advantage keyboard with foot pedal:)
